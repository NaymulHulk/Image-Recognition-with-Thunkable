# Image-Recognition-with-Thunkable
This is a small fun project I did over a day to get used with the idea of app development with Thunkable.

To install the app, 

1.Download from the following google drive link:
  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iXjlWETGRvmCJMn4nb3XGPKvDeF6KvEh
  
2.Continue the steps of installations and agree to the camera and gallery access as the app will require it.

3. Open the app, and take picture of any object. It uses Microsoft Image recognition to detect the object and explain as closely as    possible.
